Earlier, criteria like net worth, experience etc. used to be \\nprescribed. Based on experience and in consultation with concerned departments, Government has \\ndecided to prescribe the following additional criteria for the qualification/ disqualification of the \\nparties seeking to acquire stakes in public sector enterprises through disinvestment: \\n \\n(a) In regard to matters other than the security and integrity of the country, any conviction \\nby a Court of Law or indictment/ adverse order by a regulatory authority that casts a \\ndoubt on the ability of the Bidder to manage the public sector unit when it is \\ndisinvested, or which relates to a grave offence would constitute disqualification. \\nGrave offence is defined to be of such a nature that it outrages the moral sense of the \\ncommunity. The decision in regard to the nature of the offence would be taken on case \\nto case basis after considering the facts of the case and relevant legal principles, by the \\nGovernment of India. \\n(b) In regard to matters relating to the security and integrity of the country, any charge-\\nsheet by an agency of the Government/ conviction by a Court of Law for an offence \\ncommitted by the bidding party or by any sister concern of the bidding party would \\nresult in disqualification. The decision in regard to the relationship between the sister \\nconcerns would be taken, based on the relevant facts and after examining whether the \\ntwo concerns are substantially controlled by the same person/ persons. \\n(c) In both (a) and (b), disqualification shall continue for a period that Government deems \\nappropriate. \\n(d) Any entity, which is disqualified from participating in the disinvestment process, \\nwould not be allowed to remain associated with it or get associated merely because it \\nhas preferred an appeal against the order based on which it has been disqualified. The \\nmere pendency of appeal will have no effect on the disqualification. \\n \\n(e) The disqualification criteria would come into effect immediately and would apply to all \\nBidders for various disinvestment transactions, which have not been completed as yet. \\n(f) Before disqualifying a concern, a Show Cause Notice why it should not be disqualified \\nwould be issued to it and it would be given an opportunity to explain its position.  \\n(g) Henceforth, these criteria will be prescribed in the advertisements seeking Expression \\nof Interest (EOI) from the interested parties. The interested parties would be required to \\nprovide the information on the above criteria, along with their Expressions of Interest Construction of Bypass To Mozari Town on NH-53 (Existing Km.118+7 00 to Km.124+400) (Design Chainage – \\nKm.0+000 to Km.6+100) in the State of Maharashtra on EPC Mode    \\n67 \\n (EOI). The Bidders shall be required to provide with their EOI an undertaking to the \\neffect that no investigation by a regulatory authority is pending against them. In case \\nany investigation is pending against the concern or its sister concern or against its CEO \\nor any of its Directors/ Managers/ employees, full details of such investigation \\nincluding the name of the investigating agency, the charge/ offence for which the \\ninvestigation has been launched, name and designation of persons against whom the \\ninvestigation has been launched and other relevant information should be disclosed, to \\nthe satisfaction of the Government. For other criteria also, a similar undertaking shall \\nbe obtained along with EOI. \\n \\nsd/- \\n(A.K.
